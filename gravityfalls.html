			<p>For their summer vacation, 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel Pines are dropped off from their home in
				Piedmont, California, to the fictitious town of Gravity Falls, Roadkill County, Oregon, to spend the
				summer with their great uncle Stan Pines (often shortened to Grunkle Stan), who runs a tourist trap
				called the "Mystery Shack". Things are not what they seem in this small town, and with the help of a
				mysterious journal that Dipper finds in the forest, they begin unraveling the town's mysteries each day.
